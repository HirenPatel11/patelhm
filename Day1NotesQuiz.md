## Understanding GitHub and GitHub Classroom
***
Git
***
* Created by Linus Torvalds in April 2005
* 90% of companies use Git for version control

***
Git DVC
***
* No central server needed
* Can work without internet connection
* There is a difference between Git and GitHub
* Developers can put any type of files in the Git and combine their work later
* Every copy of Git repository can serve either as the server or as a client
  * Repository
    * Repos are used to organize a single project
    * Contains folders, files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and other data constructs
* Branching 
      * When working on a project, there will be many ideas given. some good some not. Branching helps manage workflow
      * Ideas do not work? delete the branch
  * Main (master)
    * Anything in the main branch is always deployable
    * This branch has the latest working commit
  * Commits
    * Once main is created its time to start making changes
    * Break problems into smaller parts
    * Write clear concise committee messages
  * Pull Request
    * Go and pull my code
    * Start code review and conversations about proposed changes before merged into main 
  * Merge and Deploy
    * After pull request is reviewed and branch passes the tests, you deploy changes to verify in production
* GitHub
  * Host’s git code repos
  * Most popular Git host
  * Allows user to work on projects from anywhere
